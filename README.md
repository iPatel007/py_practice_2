# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains practice projects for Python, focusing on feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using the `deliveries.csv` dataset.

## Project Overview

### Feature Engineering
- Techniques to create new features from existing data.
- Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing data to uncover patterns and insights.
- Summary statistics, data distributions, and correlation analysis.

### Model Training
- Building and evaluating machine learning models.
- Techniques for model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics.

## Dataset

The `deliveries.csv` dataset contains information about deliveries. The dataset will be used for all the practice projects in this repository.
